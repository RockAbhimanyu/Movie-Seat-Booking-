# Movie-Seat-Booking-
This project is to create an interactive web application that allows users to select seats for a movie screening and view the total price based on their selections.
The HTML file contains elements for selecting a movie, displaying seat availability, showing the seating layout, and displaying the count of selected seats and the total price.
The CSS file styles these elements to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.
Functionality:
=>Users can select a movie from a dropdown list, each with a different price.
=>Seats are displayed as selectable elements in rows. Users can click on available seats to select them.
=>The count of selected seats and the total price are dynamically updated as users select or deselect seats.
=>Selected seats are visually distinguished from available and occupied seats.
=>The interface provides a 3D-like effect for the seating layout.
Local Storage:
=>The project utilizes local storage to store data about selected seats and the chosen movie. This ensures that the user's selections persist even if they refresh the page or navigate away and return later.
JavaScript Functionality:
=>JavaScript is used to handle interactions with the interface elements.
=>Event listeners are set up to respond to changes in the selected movie and clicks on seats.
=>Functions are defined to update the UI based on user actions and store data in local storage.
